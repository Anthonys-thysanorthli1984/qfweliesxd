Oh man, Lilo & Stitch is wild. It's like one minute you're laughing your head off at Stitch being this chaotic little blue monster, and the next you're all awww over Lilo and Nani trying to hold it all together. They're just this quirky, lovable mess that totally hits home, you know what I mean? Family is family, even when it's weird as hell.

And dude, can we talk about how I started 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it half-way through cuz I couldn't remember where I left it last time I tried to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Stitch's antics are so over-the-top! I mean, who comes up with a trouble-making alien crash-landing in Hawaii? It's absurd and genius at the same time. Like, how do they pitch that in a meeting without 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ing up?

> Also, real talk, who even knew 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   would take so damn long? Shouldn't it be faster by now? It's 2023, so where's my instant   gratification? Anyway, it was worth it cuz I forgot how killer the soundtrack is. Songs hit different when you're 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 late at night, sleepy but wired, like you're existing in another universe for a second.

The whole Ohana thing always gets to me, though. Super cliché but I still teared up. My heart was like this ball of mush. And Nani's whole I’ve-got-this attitude? Relatable but also kinda sad. Like, c’mon give the girl a break! It’s not easy being an adult and trying to keep everything from falling apart. 

bool buddy = true; // what even

Anyway, lemme know what you think if you get around to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it. I'm gonna grab some sleep before I end up dreaming about surfing with aliens, lol. Catch you later! 😴
